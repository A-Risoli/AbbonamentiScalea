    steps:
    # 1. Download the code
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # 2. Install "uv" (The fast Python package manager you are using)
    - name: Setup uv
      uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v1
      with:
        version: "latest"

    # 3. Install Python (via uv is faster/safer)
    - name: Set up Python
      run: uv python install 3.13

    # 4. Install Dependencies
    # This reads your pyproject.toml or uv.lock and installs everything
    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: uv sync

    # 5. Run PyInstaller (Build the raw executable)
    # Note: 'uv run' ensures it uses the correct virtual environment
    - name: Build with PyInstaller
      run: |
          uv run pyinstaller AbbonamentiScalea.spec --noconfirm --clean

    # 6. Compile Installer with Inno Setup (The Professional Step)
    # This looks for your 'installer.iss' file to create the setup.exe
    - name: Compile Inno Setup Installer
      uses: Minionguyjosh/inno-setup-action@v1.2.2
      with:
        path: installer.iss
        # Ensure your installer.iss points to the 'dist/AbbonamentiScalea' folder generated by PyInstaller

    # 7. Upload the Artifacts (So you can download them)
    - name: Upload Build Artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: AbbonamentiScalea-Setup
        path: Output/*.exe 
        # Note: Change 'Output/*.exe' to wherever Inno Setup saves the file. 
        # If you skip Inno Setup, change path to 'dist/'
